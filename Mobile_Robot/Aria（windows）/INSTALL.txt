ARIA Installation Instructions
===============================
Version 2.9.0-1

Don't forget to sign up for the Aria-Users mailing list by sending a message 
with the subject 'subscribe' to aria-users-request@mobilerobots.com.

ARIA software development is supported on Windows using MS Visual
C++, and on GNU/Linux using GNU development tools (make, GCC).  It is
possible to build ARIA on other Posix/Unix-like systems but this is
not officially supported or as frequently tested as Linux and Windows. 
You can discuss use of ARIA on other operating systems or build environments
on the aria-users group mailing list.

See README.txt for more information.


Windows:
--------

Run Aria-2.9.0-1.exe to invoke the setup program, then simply
follow the prompts.  All ARIA software will be installed in 
C:\Program Files\MobileRobots\Aria.  Shortcuts will be installed
in the Start menu to documentation, examples, and the Aria directory.

The kit includes the Aria library and two pre-built examples
that you can run from the bin directory. More examples are available in the 
examples directory. Visual C++ projects are provided to build (most) example
programs, as well as for ARIA itself.

In order to compile ARIA and the examples, you should use Microsoft 
Visual C++.  Free "Express" versions are available from Microsoft.

See README.txt and the ARIA API Reference documentation for more details
on how to build and get started using ARIA with your robot.


GNU/Linux:
----------

To use the precompiled Aria library under Linux, you will need GCC
(with the C++ compiler, g++) and Make.  The ARIA libraries and examples 
come built with the standard GCC version for their distribution platform
(Indicated in the package file name).  If you would like to rebuild them with a 
different compiler or version, run "make clean; make" from the top 
level /usr/local/Aria directory.  You can also set environment 
variables to affect compilation with make, such as CXX and CXXFLAGS. 
For example, if you want to use the command "g++-3.4" to compile, set
CXX to g++-3.4 and export the variable. See README.txt for more discussion
of this.

The ARIA and ArNetworking libraries and some pre-built examples are included.
You can run these examples and find more examples in the examples 
directory.  All ARIA software is placed in /usr/local/Aria.  In addition, 
the file /etc/Aria will be created with the ARIA installation location, 
and /etc/ld.so.conf may be updated to include /usr/local/Aria/lib. 



To install on Debian or Ubuntu:
-------------------------------

ARIA libraries are provided by the following packages: libaria, 
libaria-python, libaria-java.  libaria provides libArNetworking as well 
as libAria, and all documentation, source code, and example programs.
libaria-python and libaria-java provide the Python and Java wrapper 
libraries respectively.

To install a .deb package file for Ubuntu 12 downloaded from the website, use dpkg.
For example:
   dpkg -i libaria_2.9.0-1+ubuntu12_i386.deb

Aria will be installed in /usr/local/Aria.

You may also need to install dependencies using apt-get, aptitude, 
synaptic, or the Ubuntu Software Center.

To uninstall the ARIA libraries, use 'apt-get remove libaria'. Any
packages that depend on libaria will also be removed.


To install on other GNU/Linux/Unix-like systems:
------------------------------------------------

Many Linux systems use either the RPM or DEB packaging formats, or
a tool such as "alien" can be used to convert.  Alternatively, you
may download the source code as a compressed 'tar' archive and 
compile Aria yourself (See README.txt for notes about compiling 
the source).

Unpack the .tar.gz archive:
   tar xzvf ARIA-2.9.0-1.tgz

Enter the new directory, and use make to build ARIA:
   cd Aria-2.9.0-1
   make

To install Aria, become the root user and use make again:
   su
   ...
   make install

Aria will be installed in /usr/local/Aria.   The dynamic (shared) 
libraries are in /usr/local/Aria/lib and the header files are in
/usr/local/Aria/include and /usr/local/Aria/ArNetworking/include.

Next, you will then need to tell the dynamic linker where to find the ARIA 
libraries: either add "/usr/local/Aria/lib" to /etc/ld.so.conf for 
permanent effect, or add it to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable 
for temporary effect.

All future development should use the installed Aria, not the source
you unpacked, so that directory may be removed.

The ARIA libraries depend require only the following standard Linux 
system libraries: libpthread, libdl 2, librt 1, libm 6, libc 6, libstdc++ 6.
So on most current systems you should not need to install anything 
extra to use ARIA.

refer to README.txt, the ARIA reference manual at doc/index.html, and
the ArNetworking reference manual at ArNetworking/doc/index.html. Information 
is also available on the support website http://robots.mobilerobots.com .
